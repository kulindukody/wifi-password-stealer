# Wi-Fi Password Extractor

This Python script extracts Wi-Fi network SSIDs and passwords from XML files generated by the Windows `netsh` command and sends them to a custom webhook URL.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Internet connectivity for sending data to the webhook URL.
- A webhook URL where you want to send the extracted data.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the script (`wifi_password_extractor.py`) in a text editor.
3. Replace `'webhook url'` with your actual webhook URL in the `url` variable.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script (`wifi_password_extractor.py`) is located.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:
4. The script will generate a file named `passwords.txt` in the same directory, containing the extracted SSIDs and passwords.
5. It will also attempt to send this data to the specified webhook URL.

## Security Considerations

- Be cautious when using this script, as it involves extracting sensitive Wi-Fi passwords.
- Make sure you have permission to access and extract Wi-Fi passwords on the target system.
- Keep the `passwords.txt` file secure, as it contains sensitive information.

## Disclaimer

This script is intended for educational and personal use only. Unauthorized access to Wi-Fi networks and their passwords may violate privacy and legal regulations. Use it responsibly and only on networks where you have explicit permission.
